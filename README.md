Hi there, I'm Josh. I work primarily in natural language processing and backend development, and also occasionally as a translator and interpreter. 
I am based out of Seattle these days, but up until recently was living in Japan and go back pretty frequently. 


If you are interested in working with me on something, please feel to reach out. I am most interested in language or NLP related projects - in particular those that support language learners - but I am always happy to hear about a good idea. I also consult, if your company needs help solving tricky NLP problems. More information can be found on my [personal site](https://joshuatanner.dev/).

日本語も話せるので、日本語でも遠慮なく連絡してください。特にissueなどを英語で書く必要はありません。

Software engineer with a passion for languages, focused on natural language processing and backend development. Currently working on using machine learning to help language learners at a [research lab](http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/new/) in the University of Tokyo. 

My limited free time is spent on [cardbuilder](https://github.com/Mindful/cardbuilder), trying to make the process of flashcard creation and new vocabulary acquisition in general a little less painful. 

If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out.
日本語対応も問題ない（はず）です。

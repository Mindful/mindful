Hi there! My name is Joshua Tanner, and I currently work as a software engineer at [Mantra Inc.](https://mantra.co.jp/) As an engineer I work primarily in natural language processing and backend development, and I also occasionally work as a translator and interpreter.


If you are interested in working with me on something, please feel to reach out. I am most interested in language or NLP related projects - in particular those that support language learners - but I am always happy to hear about a good idea.

日本語も話せるので、日本語の方が楽な方は遠慮なく日本語で連絡してください。
